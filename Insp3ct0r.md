We start off at a webpage and are greeted with text saying it’s someone’s first webpage and the languages used to make it. <br>
I opened up the browser’s dev tools and started looking at the source code. <br>
In the `head` section there are some links to other indexes on that site. <br>

Towards the bottom of the homepage there’s a comment with the first part of the flag. <br>

After visiting the second page and inspecting the contents, at the end is the second half of our flag. <br>

Now let’s look at the last index we found and see if the third part of the flag is there. <br>
Sure enough it is! <br>
