Description<br>
Can you get the flag?<br>
Run this Python program in the same directory as this encrypted flag.<br>

Started off grabbing the files to the webshell with `wget` then checked out the python script with `nano`. <br>
Inspecting the code, the first thing that caught my eye was the IF statement mentioning the user password. <br>
Itâ€™s saying that if the password entered is equal to what is in the code then the flag will be printed. <br>

This is what we get after combining the lines. <br>

I ran the script and entered the password at the prompt and the flag was printed out. <br>
