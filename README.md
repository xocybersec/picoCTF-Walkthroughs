I am excited to present my methodology for solving picoCTF challenges, showcasing my proven Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) in the realm of cybersecurity. 
In this repository, I provide step-by-step guidance on how I approach and work through various challenges on the picoCTF platform. 
By sharing my TTPs, I aim to contribute to the learning community and demonstrate my hands-on problem-solving skills in capture the flag (CTF) scenarios.
